# Object_Detection# Optimizing FasterRCNN ResNet-50 for Object Detection on Edge Devices

## Overview
This project focuses on the review, evaluation, and pruning of the FasterRCNN ResNet-50 model, with the aim of optimizing it for deployment on edge devices such as the Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the PyTorch framework, the project enhances the model's efficiency while maintaining its accuracy, making it suitable for real-time object detection in resource-constrained environments.

## Key Components
- **Model Selection:** FasterRCNN ResNet-50 was chosen after an extensive literature review and comparison with other object detection models, including YOLO, EfficientDet, and RetinaNet.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model was validated using standard metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS), tested on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset.
- **Model Pruning:** To reduce the model's size and computational load, a magnitude-based pruning technique was implemented, targeting specific channels in the neural network while preserving the model's detection capabilities.
